<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>Hello! I'm Hillary, a passionate, aspiring Web Developer with a love for technology. Ever since I was a kid, I've been fascinated by how computers work, and this curiosity has led me on an incredible journey.</p>

<p>What sets me apart is my unwavering dedication to learning and staying up to date with the tech industry. Whether I'm building projects or interacting with fellow coders, I always strive to bring creativity and enthusiasm to everything I do.</p>

<p>When I'm not practicing coding, you can find me playing video games or reading a good book, and I'm always up for a lengthy conversation about all things Disney.</p>
